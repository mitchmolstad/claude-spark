# [Project Name]

Run `/spark` to set up this project. The spark interview will generate
all documentation and configure the workflow for your specific project.

## Session Ritual

1. **First time**: Run `/spark` (one-time project interview)
2. **Start**: Run `/start` to hydrate context
3. **Work**: Stay on critical path
4. **End**: Run `/done` to sync all documentation
5. **Reset**: Use `/clear` to reset context once state is persisted
